Instructions to Play the Game
Flappy Bird is a simple yet addictive game where the objective is to navigate a bird through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The game begins on the main page, where you can start the game by clicking the play button. Once clicked, a modal window will appear, prompting you to enter your name. After entering your name and clicking the "Enter" button, you will be redirected to the game screen where the gameplay begins.

Controls and Commands
o	Starting the Game: Click the play button on the main page and enter your name in the modal window that appears.

o	Jumping: Press the spacebar or the up-arrow key to make the bird jump. Each press will cause the bird to flap its wings and ascend.

o	Navigating: Use quick, rhythmic taps on the spacebar or up arrow key to keep the bird at an optimal altitude, avoiding both the upper and lower pipes.



Tips and Tricks
o	Timing Your Jumps: The key to success in Flappy Bird is mastering the timing of your jumps. Press the spacebar or up arrow key just as the bird begins to descend to maintain a steady altitude.

o	Stay in the Middle: Try to keep the bird in the middle of the screen vertically. This position gives you the most time to react to the upcoming pipes.
o	Small Movements: Make small, controlled taps rather than holding down the key. This will help you make finer adjustments and avoid over-correcting.

o	Practice Makes Perfect: The game can be challenging at first, but with practice, you will get a better feel for the timing and rhythm required to navigate the pipes successfully.

o	Focus on the Gaps: Always keep your eyes on the gaps between the pipes rather than the bird itself. This helps in anticipating the next move and ensures smoother navigation.

o	Stay Calm: Flappy Bird is a game that tests your patience and reaction time. Staying calm and composed will help you make better decisions and avoid hasty movements that can lead to collisions.
